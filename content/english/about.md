# Hello there! I'm Julia.

I'm a globetrotting technologist at [Veeam](https://www.veeam.com/) who's wildly passionate about Cloud Native technologies and DevOps. Hailing from Brazil with a dash of French roots and currently calling NYC home, I've made it my mission to make Cloud and DevOps not just understood, but truly accessible to everyone.

## Community Champion
Beyond code, I believe in the power of community. Serving as an AWS Community Builder, [CNCF Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/?_sft_lf-country=us&_sft_lf-expertise=non-technical&p=julia-furst-morgado), Women Techmakers Ambassador, and a Girl Code Ambassador, I aim to build bridges, not walls, in the tech world. You'll also find me orchestrating the [NY Code & Coffee Meetup](https://www.newyorkcodeandcoffee.com/), where we make space for open dialogues and fun learning experiences. For me, it's all about harnessing tech to foster collaboration, inclusivity, and growth in our communities.

## Tech & Culture Intersection
I've been lucky to travel the world and learn from a rich tapestry of cultures. I carry these experiences into my work, understanding how technology can weave together cultures and build bridges of understanding.

## Pivot and Adapt
My professional journey has been an adventure in itself - from law to marketing, and now, technology. I'm a self-made software engineer, bringing together my resilience, adaptability, and a knack for self-learning to make my mark in the tech world.
