# Hello there! I'm Julia.

I'm a globetrotting technologist at [Veeam](https://www.veeam.com/) who loves diving into Cloud tech and DevOps, making it easy for everyone to join in! Originating from Brazil with a touch of French heritage I currently call NYC home but you'll find me on the plane most of the time.

## Bridging Through Community
More than just tech, I believe in the magic of community. I'm proudly an [AWS Container Hero](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/julia-morgado/?did=dh_card&trk=dh_card), [CNCF Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/?_sft_lf-country=us&_sft_lf-expertise=non-technical&p=julia-furst-morgado), [Google Women Techmakers Ambassador](https://developers.google.com/womentechmakers), [Civo Ambassador](https://www.civo.com/ambassadors) and a [Girl Code Ambassador](https://www.girl-code.co.uk/). I aim to build bridges, not walls, in the tech world and making it an inclusive space for everyone to thrive in. You'll also find me orchestrating the [KCD NY](https://community.cncf.io/kcd-new-york/), and the [AWS Community Day New York](https://www.awscommunitynewyork.com/), where we make space for open dialogues and fun learning experiences. For me, it's all about harnessing tech to foster collaboration, inclusivity, and growth in our communities.

## Intersection of Tech & Culture
I've been lucky to travel the world and learn from a rich tapestry of cultures. I carry these experiences into my work, understanding how technology can weave together cultures and build bridges of understanding.

## My Journey
My professional path has been an adventure, spanning law, marketing, and now technology. As a self-made engineer, I blend resilience, adaptability, and a penchant for self-learning to make an impact in the tech world.
