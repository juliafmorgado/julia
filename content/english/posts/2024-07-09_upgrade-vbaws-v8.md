## How and Why to Update Veeam Backup for AWS to Version 8

With the recent launch of Veeam Backup for AWS (VB for AWS) version 8 on July 2nd, it's time to update your setup to take advantage of the latest features and improvements. 

Version 8 introduces several enhancements, including tighter integration with Veeam Backup & Replication (VBR). By connecting VB for AWS with VBR, you can leverage VBR-specific features such as backup copies and central management for your cloud backup appliances. This integration simplifies management and provides additional capabilities that enhance your data protection strategy.

In this guide, I'll walk you through each step to help you successfully upgrade your Veeam Backup for AWS to version 8.

- **All user guides, manuals, and other documentation:** [Veeam Help Center](https://www.veeam.com/documentation-guides-datasheets.html)

## Key Points Before You Begin

1. **VBR Integration:** To benefit from the latest features, you need to connect VB for AWS with your existing VBR installation. There is no need for a dedicated VBR instance.
2. **Standalone Version:** The standalone version of VB for AWS is still available and supported. However, to access new features and updates, integration with VBR is required.
3. **Version Compatibility:** While you are required to deploy VBR to upgrade to version 8, version 7 is still supported and can be used if it meets your protection requirements.
4. **License Requirements:** [Veeam B&R Community Edition (CE)](https://www.veeam.com/products/free/backup-recovery.html) supports managing cloud backup appliances, but it is limited to 10 instances. If you use a VUL key for licensing VB for AWS, you can use the same key for VBR.

## What’s New in Version 8

Veeam Backup for AWS delivers AWS-native backup and disaster recovery that’s easy, cost-effective, and secure. Quickly recover from any cloud data loss scenario - whether due to outages, accidental deletion, malware, and more - in minutes. Here are the main features that you will get with the Version 8 of VB for AWS:

- **Amazon Redshift Cluster protection**
- **Amazon FSx protection**
- **Immutability extension improvements:** Save up to 30% on costs compared to the previous version for backups stored in S3 using immutability. Veeam Backup for AWS will now use a default generation period of up to 25 days for immutability, compared to a fixed 10-day period in previous versions.
- **Imageless deployment:** Deploy backup appliances directly from the Veeam Backup & Replication server to reduce complexity and enhance the efficiency of managing your infrastructure. This method ensures a consistent environment, significantly reducing the likelihood of configuration errors and improving the reliability of your deployments.

### Step 1: Understanding Update Process

When attempting to update directly from the Veeam Backup for AWS Appliance, you might notice that the update cannot be installed this way anymore. This is because Veeam Backup for AWS is now connected to Veeam Backup & Replication, and the update must be performed through the Veeam Backup & Replication console.
