Snapshots are a way to capture a point-in-time copy of your data stored in the cloud. Think of it as taking a snapshot of your files, similar to taking a picture. These snapshots can be used for data protection, recovery, and backup purposes. They allow you to create a copy of your data at a specific moment, preserving its state.
