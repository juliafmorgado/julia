At some point in our lives, most of us find ourselves standing in front of a group, ready to perform. Whether it's delivering a toast at a wedding, making an announcement at a parents' meeting, presenting to colleagues, pitching to clients, or giving a speech at a conference, public speaking is a common challenge we all face.

Overcoming the fear of public speaking can have a significant positive impact on both our personal and professional lives. To help improve your stage performance, here are some valuable tips that I've personally used:

Focus on the audience: Take a moment to truly see and hear them. Engage with their presence and maintain eye contact throughout your performance.

Remember that your performance is just one part of the overall audience experience. Their perception is also influenced by factors such as the company they keep and their activities throughout the day.

If you're feeling tense, your audience will likely feel the same. Strive to project ease and confidence, as your demeanor will have a direct impact on their engagement and response.

Utilize material that you are comfortable with. By selecting content that you are familiar and at ease with, you can be fully present in your performance instead of struggling with the delivery.

Double-check everything before you start. Ensure that your slides are in order, any audio or visual elements are functioning properly, and all technical aspects are set up correctly.

Direct your attention to individuals in the farthest corners of the room, gradually working your way forward. By doing so, you ensure that everyone feels included and no one is left out, even those seated at the back.

Put yourself in the shoes of your audience. When someone is giving a talk, what do you think? Most likely, you admire their courage to be on stage. Remember that if you make a mistake, people are usually forgiving and will quickly forget it once the talk is over.

Lastly, here's a valuable tip from my manager, Rick: Don't forget about S.P.E.C.

S - SMILE: A genuine smile can instantly create a positive and welcoming atmosphere.
P - PACE: Maintain an appropriate pace in your speech, ensuring that your words are clear and understandable.
E - ENERGY: Infuse your performance with enthusiasm and energy, capturing the audience's attention and keeping them engaged.
C - CLARITY: Deliver your message with clarity and precision, so that your audience can easily grasp and remember your key points.
By applying these tips and incorporating the S.P.E.C. framework, you can enhance your stage performance and conquer the fear of public speaking, leading to personal growth and professional success.
