"I am not in DevOps or SRE. Should I learn Kubernetes?"


I get this questions a LOT.


TLDR: Yes.


Kubernetes as a software engineer, even if you're not in DevOps or SRE, can be really helpful for your career. It's like how knowing Linux was a sign of a good developer back in the day. Nowadays, most server-side software is deployed on Kubernetes, so getting familiar with it can make your life easier.


Spending a couple of weeks to understand Kubernetes terminology, get some hands-on experience, and grasp the operating environment where your software will run is definitely a smart investment. It'll make debugging easier and give you a better understanding when making important architectural decisions.


Plus, there are tons of companies working on Kubernetes tools and related solutions, and they're all hiring. The Kubernetes ecosystem is booming, with billions of dollars pouring in from VCs and the industry. So being a software engineer who knows Kubernetes can easily land you a job.


Here are a few reasons why learning Kubernetes is worth it:


Containerization: Kubernetes is all about managing containerized applications, which are super important in software development. Learning Kubernetes allows you to effectively handle and deploy these containerized apps, taking advantage of scalability, portability, and isolation.


Scalability and High Availability: Kubernetes has awesome features for scaling applications and making sure they're always available. It can automatically adjust the number of instances based on workload demands and spread the load across different containers or nodes. If you understand Kubernetes, you can design and deploy systems that scale and stay up even under heavy traffic.


Infrastructure as Code: With Kubernetes, you describe your application's infrastructure using YAML or JSON files. It's like treating your infrastructure as code, making it easier to manage, collaborate on, and automate deployments. This aligns well with modern DevOps practices and helps you handle infrastructure changes smoothly.


Cloud-Native Development: Kubernetes is widely used in cloud-native development. It plays nicely with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Many cloud providers even offer managed Kubernetes services, making it a breeze to deploy and manage your Kubernetes clusters in the cloud.


Industry Adoption: Kubernetes is hugely popular and widely adopted by companies of all sizes. Lots of organizations are either moving their apps to Kubernetes or building new ones directly on it. By learning Kubernetes, you make yourself more employable and open up opportunities to work on exciting projects.


While you're learning Kubernetes, it's good to have a solid understanding of containerization concepts, networking, and distributed systems. It's also helpful to be familiar with Linux command-line tools and containerization technologies like Docker.


Considering the high demand for Kubernetes skills and its prevalence in modern software development, investing time in learning Kubernetes is definitely a smart move for a software engineer. It's one of the most sought-after skills, and many companies are using it. So go for it!
