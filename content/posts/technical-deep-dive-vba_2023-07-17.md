## Policy-Based Backup Protection
At the core of Veeam Backup for AWS is its policy-based backup protection mechanism, which allows for efficient management of instance-based workloads. With backup policies, you can define granular parameters such as IAM roles, regions, protection rules, exclusion rules, snapshot settings, backup settings, cost estimation, and notification settings. By automating the backup inclusion process based on these policies, Veeam Backup for AWS simplifies your backup operations, enhances consistency, and saves valuable time.

## Granular Cost Estimation
Veeam Backup for AWS provides granular cost estimation to help you understand the potential costs associated with your backup policies. The cost estimator breaks down backup costs, snapshot costs, traffic costs, and transaction costs, allowing for precise financial planning and optimization of your backup strategy.

## Dynamic Worker Nodes
To optimize data transfer efficiency and reduce costs within AWS, Veeam Backup for AWS leverages dynamically provisioned worker nodes. These nodes perform essential tasks, such as image-based backups and file-level recovery, on EC2 instances. The worker nodes are automatically spun up only when data needs to be transferred and are terminated promptly once the tasks are completed. This approach minimizes unnecessary resource consumption and reduces expenses associated with backup and restore transactions.

## IAM Roles
Veeam Backup for AWS integrates seamlessly with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to enforce least-privileged access permissions. By configuring IAM roles, you can ensure that only authorized entities can perform backup and restore operations, enhancing the security of your AWS backup environment.
