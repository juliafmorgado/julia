This is the beginning of a glossary I'm building with easier explanations about Git and GitHub terms. I will update it and make it look nicer soon ðŸ˜Š

- security update: the process of applying security fixes to software or a system to protect it from vulnerabilities or potential threats.

- blob: an object stored in the Git repository that represents a file.

- branch: a branching off from the original repository where changes and tests can be made without affecting the main code.

- bug: an error in the code that causes unexpected behavior in the system.

- centralized: referring to a version control system where there is a single centralized copy of the source code, and all changes are sent to that single copy to be integrated, unlike the decentralized collaboration offered by Git.

- code check-in: adding or uploading changes to the central version control repository. It is the inverse operation of "check-out".

- code check-out: downloading or getting a copy of existing code from a repository to work on locally. This can include switching to a specific branch or checking out a specific version of the code.

- cherry-pick: applying one or more changes from a specific commit to another branch.

- class: a template for creating objects (instances) that have specific attributes and behaviors, sharing the same structure and data.

- CLI: Command Line Interface.

- clone: creating an exact copy of a Git repository on your local machine, so you can work on it and send your changes back to the original repository.

- open-source: referring to software whose source code is freely available to be modified and shared by anyone, allowing collaboration and maintenance.

- stable code: referring to code that has been tested and bug-fixed, and is considered safe and reliable for use in production.

- source code: the set of files that contains instructions written in a programming language that form a software or application.

- decentralized collaboration: referring to the process of working on a project with multiple developers, where each developer has a complete copy of the repository and can make commits and create branches without relying on a single central source of control.

- project collaboration: referring to the practice of working together with other developers on projects.

- collaborator: a person with permission to contribute to a repository.

- command Line Interface (CLI): a command-line interface to interact with Git.

- commit: saving and recording a new version of a file or set of files in the repository, usually with a message describing the changes made.

- committing: the act of recording changes made to a file or set of files in a repository.

- project community: a group of developers, contributors, and other interested individuals who work together to improve and expand an open-source or private project.

- conflict: a situation where two different changes attempt to modify the same line of a file.

- merge conflicts: situations where two or more branches contain conflicting changes in the same file or line, preventing the merging of changes into a single branch.

- code version control: the technique of managing changes to the source code of a project, allowing previous versions to be recovered and collaborators to work together with the integration of changes.

- credits: recognition of individuals or organizations that have contributed to a project, usually listed in a credits file or in the project's README.

- DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph): a version control graph that represents the relationships between commits.

- deployment: the process of publishing an application into production.

- diff: visualization of the differences between commits or branches.

- feature branch: a branch used for the development of a new feature.

- fork: the action of creating a copy of an existing repository on GitHub, so that it can be worked on independently without affecting the original repository.

- source code management: the process of tracking and managing changes made to the source code
