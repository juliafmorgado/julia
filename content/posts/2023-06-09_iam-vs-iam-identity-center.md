Managing access to AWS resources can be a daunting task, especially when dealing with multiple accounts and applications. Fortunately, AWS offers [two services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-prereqs.html#getting-started-prereqs-iam), IAM (Identity and Access Management) and IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS Single Sign-On), to simplify access management. Let's dive deeper into the differences between these services, empowering you to make an informed decision for your organization.

## IAM - Identity Access Management

IAM, the stalwart of AWS access management, serves as the gatekeeper for your AWS resources. It provides a comprehensive suite of features to control and manage user access and access to resources and apps within you AWS account. With IAM, you can create and manage users, groups, and roles. You have the power to grant precise permissions through policies, defining who can access specific resources and what actions they can perform. For instance, you can grant developers the ability to provision EC2 instances while limiting HR personnel to view-only access for employee data. IAM gives you fine-grained control and flexibility over your access policies.

You can also combine users into groups, making it easier to manage users that need the same set of permissions.

## IAM Identity Center

IAM Identity Center, on the other hand, focuses on simplifying access management, especially for organizations juggling multiple AWS accounts and applications. It serves as a centralized hub for managing the sign-in security of your workforce users. Workforce users are individuals within your organization who require access to AWS resources. IAM Identity Center allows you to create and connect these users, streamlining their access across all AWS accounts and applications.

A key feature of IAM Identity Center is the concept of permission sets. Permission sets define a user's access across multiple accounts and applications. They eliminate the need to manually create roles in each individual account, reducing administrative burden and ensuring consistency. IAM Identity Center also offers a user-friendly web interface for seamless sign-in and easy switching between accounts, enhancing the user experience.

Now I want to address some common questions around these two products.

## Is there a reason to use AWS IAM over AWS IAM Identity Center for the management of multiple account setup?
Not really.

Of cours it will also depends on the specific needs of your organization. IAM excels in providing granular control, allowing you to tailor access permissions to the finest detail. It is an excellent choice for organizations with complex permission requirements or stringent security needs. On the other hand, IAM Identity Center shines in managing access for a large workforce spread across multiple accounts and applications. It simplifies the process, reducing administrative overhead and enhancing user productivity.

Ultimately, the choice depends on your organization's size, complexity, and access management priorities. Some organizations might benefit from the precision and customization offered by IAM, while others might find the centralized and streamlined approach of IAM Identity Center more suitable.
