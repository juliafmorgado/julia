Have you ever found yourself thinking, "I don't think I'm ready yet", "I don‚Äôt have enough experience", or "I need to wait a while more..."? Sounds familiar, right? I'm glad I'm not the only one üòÖ

While the idea of being "ready" can sometimes be helpful, it often holds us back. It prevents us from learning something new, trying different things, or even applying for that job we've been eyeing. We all wait for that magical moment when everything will feel just right. But let me tell you something: that moment will NEVER come. Life changes every day, and what feels "just right" today might feel totally different tomorrow.

It took me a long time to realize this. As a very creative person who's always bursting with bold ideas and with an adventurous spirit, I found myself constantly waiting for the perfect moment. I believed that I would totally nail it if I just had enough time, enough experience, enough... whatever! But here's a funny thing about life, especially in tech ‚Äì the more you learn, the more you realize you know nothing. This applies to many other things too. You may think once you check all the boxes, you'll finally be competent or ready. But in a few months, those requirements will have changed, your interests might have shifted, or the opportunity could have passed you by. Waiting until you know 'everything' is like chasing a mirage. The perfect time is like a rainbow. It looks amazing from far away, but the closer you get, the more it fades away. Life is messy, and guess what? It's the messy bits that make it fun.

These days, I've adopted a different approach. If I don't know something, I try it anyways. If it shows signs of success, I keep learning, working on it, and studying. The best way to get good at something is to dive in, get your hands dirty, and start learning by doing. Sure, you might mess up a few times, but that's part of the fun. You'll learn and grow as you go, and before you know it, you'll feel confident about it (trust me).

The same principle applies to our careers. We often wait for the stars to align, thinking we need to gather all the skills and experience under the sun before we go for that dream job or promotion. But here's the thing: jobs are about learning on the go.
You don't have to know everything before you start. If you've got a good portion of the skills and the passion to learn the rest, you might just be the perfect fit.
So, go ahead and apply for that job, even if you don't meet all the requirements! I've never found a job post that matches my skills 100%. There's always something that I can't check, but It doesn‚Äôt matter. Job posts are a wish list. NO ONE has all the skills a job posting describes. If they did, they've probably just left their company. What's even better is that you have 102 qualities they want but don't know yet. So, go ahead, apply, and show them what you've got!

So, what's the secret to escaping the "waiting for the right time" trap?

It's all about realizing the magic of now. This doesn't mean you should rush into things without thinking. It means understanding that you don't have to have it all figured out to start. Learning and growing are parts of the journey, not the destination.

Instead of waiting for a perfect moment that doesn't exist, you can start creating those perfect moments right here, right now.

Mark Twain once said, "The secret of getting ahead is getting started." So, let's shake off those doubts, embrace the exciting unknown, and just start. There's a whole world out there ready for you to explore. After all, you're never really ready until you start.
